# Face_Detection
Face detection is a computer vision problem that involves finding faces in photos. Face detection can be performed using the classical feature-based cascade classifier using the OpenCV library. State-of-the-art face detection can be achieved using a Multi-task Cascade CNN via the MTCNN library.

Face detection is a problem in computer vision of locating and localizing one or more faces in a photograph. Locating a face in a photograph refers to finding the coordinate of the face in the image, whereas localization refers to demarcating the extent of the face, often via a bounding box around the face.
                           
The human face is a dynamic object and has a high degree of variability in its appearance, which makes face detection a difficult problem in computer vision. Given a photograph, a face detection system will output zero or more bounding boxes that contain faces. Detected faces can then be provided as input to a subsequent system, such as a face recognition system.

Face detection is a necessary first-step in face recognition systems, with the purpose of localizing and extracting the face region from the background.

A number of deep learning methods have been developed and demonstrated for face detection. One of the more popular approaches is called the “Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network,” or MTCNN for short.
